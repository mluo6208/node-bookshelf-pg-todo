## Building WhitestormJS

WhitestormJS can be built by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and the [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) package through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

After that, clone the repository anywhere you'd like (`git clone https://github.com/WhitestormJS/whitestorm.js.git`).

Open the new directory (`./WhitestormJS/` by default) using whatever terminal emulator you'd like.

You can build WhitestormJS with the following command: `gulp`

WhitestormJS will be built, and written to `build/whitestorm.js`, and `build/whitestorm.min.js`.

#### Fixed Issue.

If your commit fixes issue on github, you must add `Fixed #25`. Where **#25 is ID of your issue.**



#### Syntax.
 
- **Code** - Can be `WIP.`, `CSF.` or `TU.` (If your commit matches one of them.)
- **Comment** - Your comment to commit. (If you want or you have no code.)
- **Fix** - Example: `Fixed #25`. (If you fixed an issue or your commit made some task from issue.)

>**After code/comment must always be a dot and they must start with big letter.**

>**If you have `CSF.` your comment must be a name of file you fixed.** No dot after filename


#### Examples.

Good:
 - `WIP. Files updated.`
 - `CSF. ShaderTerrain.js Fixed #25`
 - `WIP.`
 - `TU. Fixed #3`

Poor:
 - `Fixed #25`
 - `Fixed code style.` (Use "CSF.")

 - Each line of code should not be longer than 80 symbols
 - https://www.codacy.com/app/siteprogcom/WhitestormJS/dashboard
 - After you fixed one file:
   - Write `CSF. {filenamehere}` to current version in `CHANGELOG.md` file.
   - Commit with msg `CSF. {filenamhere} #25` or just `CSF.`

### * Adding changes to [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/WhitestormJS/whitestorm.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

**Issue fixed (extended):** `Fixed #{issueId} "{issueDesc}"`

**Fixed file/example/function:** `Fixed ...`

**Files moved:** `*folder/ -> anotherfolder/*`

**Changed structure of folder:** `*folder/ + sorted = {sortedFiles}*`

**Library update:** `**{libName} update. {rnum} -> {rnum}**`
